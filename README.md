# Bit-HeroesBot
Scripting meant to automate the Unity and Steam versions of Bit Heroes. To replace ilpersi's now non-functional Java based BHBot. Currently the entirety of the project is based around Autohotkey. Using the 'ImageSearch' and 'PixelGetColor' commands will get you pretty far knowing that everything can be automated and configured as needed. The native Imagesearch command is surprisingly reliable, and almost a little too picky and accurate. Help and recommendations are welcome for this project, please collaborate through Github or the project Discord server: http://Discord.gg/wEvJ8cmcYf

Current notes: The scripts are meant to take a similar approach to how ilpersi's cues based BHBot. By using cues, (screenshotted lossless images from BH) to to reference what is currently on screen, to decide what to execute. So far in windows 10 the ImageSearch commands within the script works with resolutions of 2560x1440, and 1920x1080 @ 100% scaling.
Bot can currently automatically detect if a user is logged in, or not. Auto login for kongregate is in the works, and steam support is last priority.

Current to do: Finish the partial auto login code, and implement full Raid functionality.
